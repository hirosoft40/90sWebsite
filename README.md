# 90's style website
Created 90's style website using html5 as a part of a project at DigitalCrafts. The main purpose of this project was to understand the differences of modern website and legacy htmls. I took a basic html course in late 90s and I remember that 90s website had visitor counters, tables, brigh text and scroll bars.
